You will get an email summary each day of new notifications on projects. They are sent at midnight NYC time. Let me know ASAP if they send multiple times and/or not at all when you are expecting them.\n-   Deleting contributors - you can delete people from a project, but see below. We are still implementing the ability to add them back in if it was an accident.\n-   We have double checked permissions and fixed it so that contributors cannot accidentally delete things or do stuff they shouldn't be able to do.\n-   When you delete projects: the project list will update automatically so you don't need to refresh to see you deleted a project.\n-   When you add something that triggers an announcement/notification: the project dashboard should update with that information automatically now.\n-   Download all your data: in working on the project summary page, we added this button:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](download_project.png){width=1175}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n-   You can now download all the data from the project in machine readable format. We are working on the human readable part, and I think you are going to like it a lot!\n-   Suggestions from users: Invite contributor leads to contributors page instead of project dashboard\n-   Added a contributor guide: this is still a work in progress, but we would love to have help!\n-   Structurally: fixed up the app components so they are easier to find, restructured so that we only create functions once instead of multiple times across the app\n-   Bug fixes! (these are boring but slight quirks we noticed)\n\n## Coming soon:\n\n-   We are still working through other comments/suggestions from users - they are very helpful!\n-   Our UX team has mentioned multiple thoughts on current pathways and layouts that are confusing. We are updating them to be smoother and add tooltips for you.\n-   You'll be able to turn off tooltips soon!\n\n## Feedback welcome:\n\n### Deleting contributors:\n\nWe have discussed this issue a lot and have come up with a plan but would love your feedback. Currently, when you delete a contributor, you actually do not really delete them. We flag them as \"deleted\". Therefore:\n\n-   They cannot see the project and/or associated information anymore.\n-   They appear on the project manager's pages as \"anonymous\".\n-   Their contributions (like completing a task, roles assigned, etc.) are still in your project but they will only show up as \"anonymous\".\n-   They *do* actually get removed from any teams they were a part of, for very practical code reasons on our side.\n\nWe went with this approach for two reasons:\n\n-   The delete was an accident: if you add them back in, all of their tasks, roles, etc. are maintained so nothing has to be \"redone\".\n-   The delete was on purpose: but we should still maintain transparency that someone did something. This is the way OSF handles deleted people.\n\nRemember contributor *does not* equal authorship in the scientific sense. We leave that up to you. We are simply saying they contributed to something on a project. Or were at least asked to.\n",
