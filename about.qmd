STAPLE was designed and coded by the following core group of people:

Erin M. Buchanan is a cognitive scientist, educator, and advocate for open and transparent science. Her research spans statistical methodology, language processing, and the development of tools that make science more collaborative and reproducible. She is a co-founder and lead developer of STAPLE (Science Tracking Across the Project Lifespan), an open-source project management platform designed to support large-scale, interdisciplinary research.

Erin has authored numerous publications on quantitative methods, psycholinguistics, and best practices in psychological science. She is also deeply committed to teaching and mentoring, helping the next generation of researchers build strong methodological foundations while fostering values of openness, rigor, and inclusivity. Through her work, she aims to bridge the gap between technology and research, creating systems that empower scientists to tackle complex, global challenges together.
