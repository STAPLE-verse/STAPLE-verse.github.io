<p>You may not use the Websites or Services to violate any applicable local, state, national, or international law, including without limitation any applicable laws relating to antitrust or other illegal trade or business practices, federal and state securities laws, regulations promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, any rules of any national or other securities exchange, and any U.S. laws, rules, and regulations governing the export and re-export of commodities or technical data. You may not upload or transmit any data, content, or material that infringes or misappropriates any person’s copyright, patent, trademark, or trade secret, or disclose via the Websites or Services any information the disclosure of which would constitute a violation of any confidentiality obligation on your part. You may not upload any viruses, worms, Trojan horses, or other forms of harmful computer code, nor subject the STAPLE’s networks or servers to unreasonable traffic loads, or otherwise engage in conduct deemed disruptive to the ordinary operation of the STAPLE’s Websites and Services. You’re strictly prohibited from communicating on or through this site any unlawful, harmful, offensive, threatening, abusive, libelous, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, profane, hateful, fraudulent, sexually explicit, racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable material of any sort, including, but not limited to, any material that encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any applicable local, state, national, or international law. You are further prohibited from harvesting addresses, email addresses, or other personal data for commercial purposes and from sending unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, or other unsolicited communications to other users of the Websites or Services. You may not use the Websites or Services in a way that harms the STAPLE or the STAPLE’s members, affiliates or vendors, or other users.

<p>You acknowledge that your unauthorized use or misuse of the Websites and Services could cause the STAPLE irreparable harm. Any unauthorized use of the Websites or Services or other breach of these Terms of Use shall automatically terminate the license granted to you by the STAPLE. In addition, the STAPLE reserves the right, but is not obligated to, investigate any potential violations of its Terms of Use and/or any behavior that is potentially unlawful, and such investigations may involve cooperation with law enforcement authorities.</p>

<section id="limitation-of-access-and-removal-of-content" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limitation-of-access-and-removal-of-content">10. LIMITATION OF ACCESS AND REMOVAL OF CONTENT</h3>
<p>The STAPLE makes commercially reasonable efforts to maintain and provide access to its Websites and Services and will endeavor to provide you with advance warning of restrictions to access due to routine website maintenance. The STAPLE, at its sole discretion, however, reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify, suspend, discontinue, or terminate the Websites or Services or portions thereof with or without notice. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, discontinuation, or termination of the Websites or Services. While the STAPLE will endeavor to continue to host all Projects, as a non-profit entity, it cannot guarantee that it will have the resources to do so over time, and it reserves the right to designate a substitute host of its choosing for Project content if the STAPLE does not have the financial means to do so itself in the future.</p>
<p>The STAPLE is not responsible for screening or reviewing content submitted to the Websites or Services. The STAPLE may temporarily or permanently remove any content on the Websites or Services at any time where the STAPLE, in its sole discretion believes the content is in violation of these Terms of Service or where the STAPLE is acting in compliance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. You are advised not to use the Websites or Services as the exclusive storage repository for your data and content. The STAPLE recommends that you separately store all data and content submitted to the Websites and Services on other secure servers or with reputable third-party hosting services.</p>
</section>
<section id="security" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="security">11. SECURITY</h3>
<p>The STAPLE uses commercially reasonable, industry-standard measures to protect the security of the STAPLE’s Websites and its Services. Despite these measures, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will not be able to defeat our security measures. Your access to some of our Websites and Services and content may be password-protected. To maintain the security of your information (or another user’s personal information that you are authorized to manage as an Administrator), you must keep your username(s) and password(s) strictly confidential and not disclose them to anyone. You will be solely responsible for any action, activities, and access to our Websites and Services that are taken using your username and password and that occurred before you notified us of their loss. If you become aware of any security breach of your password or of the security of the Websites or Services, you must contact us as soon as possible.</p>
</section>
<section id="links-and-add-ons" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="links-and-add-ons">12. LINKS AND ADD-ONS</h3>
<p>The Websites and Services may contain links or allow you to make use of Add-ons that connect to sites owned or operated by independent third parties. These links are provided for your convenience and reference only. The STAPLE’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy do not apply to those sites. We do not control such sites and, therefore, we are not responsible for any content posted on these sites or their privacy policies. The fact that the STAPLE offers such links should not be construed in any way as an endorsement, authorization, or sponsorship of that site, its content or the companies or products or services referenced therein, and the STAPLE reserves the right to note its lack of affiliation, sponsorship, or endorsement of these sites. If you decide to access any of the third-party sites linked to the STAPLE’s Websites or Services, you do this entirely at your own risk. Because some sites employ automated search results or otherwise link you to sites containing information that may be deemed inappropriate or offensive, the STAPLE cannot be held responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in third-party sites or any results that may be obtained from using them. You hereby irrevocably waive any claim against us with respect to such sites.</p>
</section>
<section id="indemnification" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="indemnification">13. INDEMNIFICATION</h3>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="termination">14. TERMINATION</h3>

The STAPLE reserves the right to terminate or suspend your access to and use of the Websites and Services, or parts of the Websites and Services, without notice, if we believe, in our sole discretion, that such use is (i) in violation of any applicable law; (ii) is harmful to our interests or the interests, including intellectual property or other rights, of another person or entity; or (iii) where the STAPLE has reason to believe that you are in violation of these Terms of Use. Termination for any reason shall not terminate any of your warranties or any of your indemnification and other obligations under these Terms of Use, or any licenses that you have or other rights that you may have granted in connection with any of your contributions.</p>
