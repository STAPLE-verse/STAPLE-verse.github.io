STAPLE is under development by Erin Buchanan, Marton Kovacs, and others. Inspired by the complexities of metadata, big-team science, and TOP principles, we are designing software for scientists!

If you would like to become an early tester for STAPLE, please email [us](mailto:staple.helpdesk@gmail.com). We will be developing the software starting Fall 2023 through Fall 2024, with the first official version releasing shortly thereafter.
