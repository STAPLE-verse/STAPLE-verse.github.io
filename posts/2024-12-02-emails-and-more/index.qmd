Hello and why is it already December?!

## Here's our current new updates:

-   Daily notifications are live! You will get an email summary each day of new notifications on projects. They are sent at midnight NYC time. Let me know ASAP if they send multiple times and/or not at all when you are expecting them.
-   Deleting contributors - you can delete people from a project, but see below. We are still implementing the ability to add them back in if it was an accident.
-   We have double checked permissions and fixed it so that contributors cannot accidentally delete things or do stuff they shouldn't be able to do.
-   When you delete projects: the project list will update automatically so you don't need to refresh to see you deleted a project.
-   When you add something that triggers an announcement/notification: the project dashboard should update with that information automatically now.
-   Download all your data: in working on the project summary page, we added this button:

```{r echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("download_project.png")
```

-   You can now download all the data from the project in machine readable format. We are working on the human readable part, and I think you are going to like it a lot!
-   Suggestions from users: Invite contributor leads to contributors page instead of project dashboard
-   Added a contributor guide: this is still a work in progress, but we would love to have help!
-   Structurally: fixed up the app components so they are easier to find, restructured so that we only create functions once instead of multiple times across the app
-   Bug fixes! (these are boring but slight quirks we noticed)

## Coming soon:

-   We are still working through other comments/suggestions from users - they are very helpful!
-   Our UX team has mentioned multiple thoughts on current pathways and layouts that are confusing. We are updating them to be smoother and add tooltips for you.
-   You'll be able to turn off tooltips soon!

## Feedback welcome:

### Deleting contributors:

We have discussed this issue a lot and have come up with a plan but would love your feedback. Currently, when you delete a contributor, you actually do not really delete them. We flag them as "deleted". Therefore:

-   They cannot see the project and/or associated information anymore.
-   They appear on the project manager's pages as "anonymous".
-   Their contributions (like completing a task, roles assigned, etc.) are still in your project but they will only show up as "anonymous".
-   They *do* actually get removed from any teams they were a part of, for very practical code reasons on our side.

We went with this approach for two reasons:

-   The delete was an accident: if you add them back in, all of their tasks, roles, etc. are maintained so nothing has to be "redone".
-   The delete was on purpose: but we should still maintain transparency that someone did something. This is the way OSF handles deleted people.

Remember contributor *does not* equal authorship in the scientific sense. We leave that up to you. We are simply saying they contributed to something on a project. Or were at least asked to.
