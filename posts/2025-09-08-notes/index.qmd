## ðŸš€ NEW FEATURE: Notes in STAPLE!

Weâ€™re excited to announce a brand-new feature in STAPLE: Notes.

Now you can capture your thoughts, meeting highlights, dataset details, and project decisions right inside STAPLE. No more juggling between documents, emails, and random sticky notes â€” everything stays with your project.

âœ¨ What you can do with Notes

-   Create notes instantly: Jot something down as soon as you think of it.

-   Pin important notes: Keep key information at the top of your project.

-   Archive old notes: Clean up your view while keeping history intact.

-   Control visibility: Keep notes private, share with project managers, or make them visible to all contributors.

-   Edit with ease: Jump back in and update anytime â€” your notes grow with your project.

## Why it matters

Research projects generate tons of details â€” decisions, to-dos, insights, context. Losing those slows everyone down. With Notes, STAPLE becomes the single place where your team can capture and find critical information.

## Try it now!

Head to your projectâ€™s Notes panel and create your first note. We canâ€™t wait to see how this helps your projects run smoother.
