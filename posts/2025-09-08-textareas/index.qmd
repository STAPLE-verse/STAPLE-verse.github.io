## Leveling Up Text Editing in STAPLE: Markdown + Previews

Managing research projects means keeping track of **a lot of text**: project descriptions, milestones, tasks, notes, and announcements. Until now, our text areas worked like simple plain-text boxes â€” you could type long passages, but formatting options were limited, and contributors had no way to see how their notes would appear to others.

That changes today. ðŸš€

## From Plain Text to Markdown

Weâ€™ve upgraded all major text fields in STAPLE to support **Markdown formatting**. That means you can now add structure to your writing with:

-   **Bulleted lists**
-   Numbered lists
-   Headings
-   Links
-   Emphasis (bold, italics, code)

Markdown is a lightweight syntax many researchers and developers already know, and it gives contributors a simple way to make their content more readable.

> âœ¨ For example:\
> Typing `1. First item` + `2. Second item` now creates a numbered list in the preview.

## Live Preview Mode

Formatting is only helpful if you can see it. Thatâ€™s why we added a **Preview toggle** to textareas across the app:

-   **Edit mode**: Write your text in Markdown.
-   **Preview mode**: See exactly how contributors will see it.

This toggle appears in project descriptions, milestones, tasks, roles, and even **notes**. For notes, we also made the preview box more readable with padding, borders, and heading adjustments.

## Clickable Links (Done Right)

Links written in Markdown (`[Open Science](https://example.org)`) now render as **clickable links**. To keep things safe, they always open in a new window with `noopener noreferrer`. Weâ€™ve styled them in STAPLEâ€™s **primary color** so they stand out.

## Cleaner Styling

To make Markdown content look consistent across the app, we added shared styling for `.markdown-display`. That means:

-   Proper spacing for paragraphs and lists
-   Compact, readable headings (h1â€“h4)
-   Background and padding so notes donâ€™t look cramped

This creates a polished, professional look while staying lightweight.

## Why This Matters

Researchers deserve tools that make project documentation **easy to read and easy to write**. With Markdown + Previews, STAPLE now helps contributors:

-   Communicate ideas clearly
-   Structure complex notes
-   Share resources with clickable links
-   Trust that what they type is what others see

This is just the beginningâ€”weâ€™ll continue refining how text, metadata, and documentation are handled across the platform.
