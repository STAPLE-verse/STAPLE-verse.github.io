## Select All in Task Assignment

Managing tasks just got easier! We’ve introduced a Select All option in the task assignment modals to help you quickly add contributors and teams.

## What’s New

- Select All Contributors: Instantly select every individual contributor in your project with one click.
- Select All Teams: Easily assign the task to all teams at once.
- Clear: Quickly deselect everyone if you need to start fresh.

## Why This Matters

Before, users had to manually click through contributor and team lists to assign tasks. This was especially tedious for larger projects. With the new buttons, you can:

- Assign tasks to entire groups instantly.
- Save time when setting up new projects or repeating tasks.
- Avoid mistakes and missed checkboxes.

## How It Looks

Inside the Select Contributors or Select Teams modals, you’ll now see two centered buttons at the top:

Once clicked, the list below updates instantly.

## What’s Next

- Translations: we are still working on adding this feature to all pages
- Project/task templates for easier copying and importing
