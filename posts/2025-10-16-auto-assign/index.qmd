## **‚ú® Making Collaboration Effortless: How STAPLE Handles Auto-Assignment**

One of the biggest challenges in managing large, multi-team science projects is **keeping everyone aligned when the team changes**. New contributors join, new teams form, and tasks evolve constantly. In most systems, that means a lot of manual re-assignment. In **STAPLE**, we built an **auto-assignment system** that makes those updates seamless ‚Äî and transparent.

### **üß© The Problem**

Before auto-assignment, adding a new person to a project meant someone had to:

-   Manually assign them to every relevant task,

-   Send notifications to keep everyone informed.

That process is tedious and error-prone ‚Äî especially in collaborative science projects where tasks and contributors change frequently.

### **‚öôÔ∏è The Idea**

Instead of manually linking people and teams to tasks, each task in STAPLE can specify how future additions should be handled via a simple dropdown:

```         
Auto-assign future additions:
  ‚ñ¢ Do not auto-assign
  ‚ñ¢ Auto-assign new contributors
  ‚ñ¢ Auto-assign new teams
  ‚ñ¢ Auto-assign new contributors & teams
```

### **üí° How It Works**

When a new project member or team joins a project, we will:

1.  Finds all tasks for that project where auto-assign matches the new addition.

2.  Connects the new Contributor or Team to each of those tasks.

3.  Sends a notification to that Contributor or Team Member.

### **üß≠ Why It Matters**

This feature creates **huge time savings** and **reduces friction** in collaborative workflows. It helps new contributors hit the ground running, keeps project managers out of busywork, and ensures data consistency across teams and tasks.
