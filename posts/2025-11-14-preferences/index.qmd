## Email Notification Update

New Feature in STAPLE: Choose How Often You Receive Email Updates

We’re excited to announce a new way to control how STAPLE keeps you informed about your research projects. You can now customize how often you receive two types of email summaries:

1.  Project Activity Updates: Get notified when something changes in your projects — such as new assignments, log entries, or updates from team members.
2.  Overdue Task Summaries: Stay aware of tasks that have passed their due dates so nothing slips through the cracks.

### ⭐ Choose the Frequency That Works for You

Every STAPLE user can now decide how often they’d like to receive each type of email update. You can select:

-   Daily — Great for active project managers and coordinators

-   Weekly — Perfect for collaborators who check in once a week

-   Never — Ideal if you prefer using dashboards and in-app views instead of email

These settings are separate, so you can mix and match. For example:

-   Daily project updates + Weekly overdue tasks

-   Weekly project updates + No overdue emails

-   Daily for both

-   Weekly for both

-   Or turn them off entirely

📍 Where to Find These Settings

You can set your preferences anytime:

1.  Go to your Profile \[circle at the top right corner\]

2.  Click Edit Profile

3.  Look for the new Email Preferences section

4.  Use the dropdown menus to select your preferred frequency

Your changes take effect immediately.

### 📬 What You’ll Receive

Your digest emails will now match your preferences exactly:

-   If you choose Daily, you’ll receive summaries every day.

-   If you choose Weekly, you’ll receive a weekly digest (typically on Sundays).

-   If you choose Never, STAPLE won’t send emails for that category.

STAPLE will only include the sections you’ve opted into. So if you choose daily project updates but weekly overdue tasks, your daily email will not include overdue information.

### 🎉 Designed to Reduce Inbox Clutter

This feature gives you more control over your workflow and helps prevent inbox overload. Whether you want frequent updates or a less noisy experience, STAPLE adapts to your research style — not the other way around.

If you have suggestions for future enhancements, we’d love to hear from you!
